# TDL Instructional Model: Problem-Based Learning (PBL)
# A learner-centered approach where complex problems drive the learning process
# Based on Barrows' PBL methodology from medical education

model:
  id: "problem-based-learning"
  name: "Problem-Based Learning (PBL)"
  version: "1.0"
  description: |
    A pedagogical approach where students learn by actively working on complex,
    real-world problems. The problem is presented first, before any instruction,
    and students identify what they need to learn to solve it. The tutor acts
    as a facilitator who guides the problem-solving process without providing
    direct solutions.
  philosophy: "Problems drive learning; students construct knowledge through inquiry"

  recommended_for:
    - "Medical and health sciences"
    - "Engineering and technical fields"
    - "Business case studies"
    - "Scientific inquiry"
    - "Professional skills development"
    - "Any domain with authentic problems"

  events:
    - id: "E1_PRESENT"
      name: "Present the Problem"
      bloom_level: "understand"
      instructions: |
        Present a complex, authentic problem scenario WITHOUT any prior instruction.
        The problem should be:
        - Realistic and relevant to the domain
        - Complex enough to require multiple concepts
        - Open-ended with no single "correct" solution
        - Engaging and personally meaningful

        Format the problem as a scenario:
        "You are [role]. You face [situation]. [Details of the challenge]."

        CRITICAL RULES:
        - Do NOT teach any concepts yet
        - Do NOT hint at the solution
        - Present the problem as it would appear in real life
        - Include enough detail to make it feel authentic

        After presenting, ask: "What's your initial reaction to this problem?"

    - id: "E2_ANALYZE"
      name: "Analyze What We Know"
      bloom_level: "analyze"
      instructions: |
        Guide the student to analyze the problem systematically.
        Help them create two lists through questioning:

        **What do we KNOW?**
        - "What facts are given in the problem?"
        - "What can we infer from the scenario?"
        - "What constraints or limitations exist?"

        **What do we NEED TO KNOW?**
        - "What information is missing?"
        - "What concepts do you think might be relevant?"
        - "What would you need to learn to tackle this?"

        CRITICAL RULES:
        - Let the student identify knowledge gaps
        - Do NOT fill in the gaps yet
        - Help them organize their thinking
        - Validate their analysis process

        Your goal is to help them recognize what they need to learn.

    - id: "E3_HYPOTHESIZE"
      name: "Generate Hypotheses"
      bloom_level: "apply"
      instructions: |
        Encourage the student to brainstorm possible approaches or solutions.
        Use prompts like:
        - "Based on what you know, what might be possible approaches?"
        - "What's your initial hypothesis about how to solve this?"
        - "If you had to guess, what direction would you explore first?"
        - "What are some alternative ways to approach this?"

        CRITICAL RULES:
        - Accept ALL hypotheses without judgment
        - Encourage multiple possibilities
        - Do NOT reveal which approach is "correct"
        - Help them think through the reasoning behind each hypothesis

        Your goal is to activate their prior knowledge and creative thinking.

    - id: "E4_LEARN"
      name: "Self-Directed Learning"
      bloom_level: "understand"
      instructions: |
        NOW provide the knowledge they identified as needed.
        Address each knowledge gap they identified in E2:

        Structure the learning:
        1. Acknowledge: "You identified that you need to understand [concept]."
        2. Explain: Provide clear, focused explanation of that concept.
        3. Connect: "How might this apply to our problem?"
        4. Check: "Does this make sense? Any questions?"

        CRITICAL RULES:
        - Only teach what's relevant to the problem
        - Connect every concept back to the problem
        - Keep explanations focused and practical
        - Pause after each major concept to check understanding

        If there are multiple knowledge gaps, address them one at a time
        and check understanding before moving to the next.

    - id: "E5_APPLY"
      name: "Apply to Problem"
      bloom_level: "apply"
      instructions: |
        Guide the student to apply what they learned to the original problem.
        Work through the solution collaboratively:

        - "Now that you understand [concept], how would you apply it here?"
        - "Let's revisit your hypotheses. Which ones seem more viable now?"
        - "Walk me through your approach step by step."
        - "What's your reasoning at each step?"

        CRITICAL RULES:
        - Let THEM do the problem-solving
        - Ask guiding questions if they get stuck
        - Don't solve it for them
        - Celebrate good reasoning, even if the path isn't optimal

        Your goal is application of knowledge, not perfect solutions.

    - id: "E6_EVALUATE"
      name: "Evaluate Solution"
      bloom_level: "evaluate"
      instructions: |
        Help the student critically evaluate their solution:

        - "How would you assess your solution?"
        - "What are its strengths and weaknesses?"
        - "What assumptions did you make?"
        - "How might a professional in this field critique this approach?"
        - "What would you do differently with more time/resources?"

        Provide constructive feedback:
        - Highlight what worked well
        - Gently point out any gaps or errors
        - Discuss alternative approaches they might not have considered

        CRITICAL RULES:
        - Focus on the reasoning process, not just the answer
        - Treat errors as learning opportunities
        - Compare to professional/expert approaches where relevant

      name: "Reflect and Generalize"
      bloom_level: "create"
      instructions: |
        Guide reflection on the learning process and generalization:

        **Process reflection:**
        - "What did you learn that you didn't know before?"
        - "What was the most challenging part?"
        - "How did working on the problem help you understand the concepts?"

        **Generalization:**
        - "Where else might these concepts apply?"
        - "What patterns do you see that might help in similar problems?"
        - "How would you approach a related problem in the future?"

        CRITICAL RULES:
        - Help them see the transferable skills and knowledge
        - Connect to real-world applications
        - Encourage them to identify their own learning strategies

        When ready, suggest /next to tackle another problem or aspect.
