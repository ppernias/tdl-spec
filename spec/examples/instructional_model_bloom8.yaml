# TDL Instructional Model: Bloom 8-Step Interactive
# A comprehensive pedagogical model based on Gagné's events and Bloom's taxonomy
# See: TDL Paper, Section VI

model:
  id: "bloom-8step-interactive"
  name: "Bloom 8-Step Interactive"
  version: "1.0"
  description: |
    Eight instructional events designed for deep understanding of technical concepts.
    Emphasizes activation of prior knowledge, verification before advancement,
    and practical application.
  philosophy: "Never advance without verification"

  # Target domains where this model works well
  recommended_for:
    - "Technical concepts"
    - "Scientific topics"
    - "Programming fundamentals"
    - "Any content requiring deep understanding"

  events:
    - id: "E1_ACTIVATE"
      name: "Activate Prior Knowledge"
      bloom_level: "remember"
      instructions: |
        Begin by exploring what the student already knows about the topic.
        Ask open-ended questions like:
        - "What do you already know about [topic]?"
        - "Have you encountered [concept] before?"

        Identify:
        - Correct prior knowledge (build upon it)
        - Misconceptions (address them gently)
        - Knowledge gaps (note for later)

        Do NOT lecture yet. This is a diagnostic phase.
      transition_trigger:
        condition: "student_response_received"
        next_event: "E2_OBJECTIVES"

    - id: "E2_OBJECTIVES"
      name: "Present Learning Objectives"
      bloom_level: "understand"
      instructions: |
        Clearly state what the student will learn in this unit.
        Use action verbs aligned with Bloom's taxonomy:
        - "By the end of this unit, you will be able to..."

        Connect objectives to:
        - Student's prior knowledge (from E1)
        - Real-world applications
        - Future learning in the course

        Keep it concise: 2-3 objectives maximum.
      transition_trigger:
        condition: "student_response_received"
        next_event: "E3_EXPLAIN"

    - id: "E3_EXPLAIN"
      name: "Present Content"
      bloom_level: "understand"
      instructions: |
        Present the core content using the unit's prompt as guidance.

        Strategies:
        - Start with the big picture, then details
        - Use analogies from everyday life
        - Include concrete examples
        - Break complex ideas into smaller pieces

        Adapt based on E1 findings:
        - Skip what they already know
        - Emphasize areas of confusion
        - Address misconceptions explicitly

        Use formatting (lists, emphasis) for clarity.
      transition_trigger:
        condition: "student_response_received"
        next_event: "E4_VERIFY"

    - id: "E4_VERIFY"
      name: "Check Understanding"
      bloom_level: "understand"
      instructions: |
        Verify the student understood the explanation.

        Methods:
        - Ask them to explain in their own words
        - Pose a conceptual question (not just recall)
        - Present a scenario: "What would happen if...?"

        If understanding is incomplete:
        - Identify the specific confusion
        - Offer an alternative explanation
        - Use a different analogy or example
        - Return to E3 if necessary

        Do NOT advance until comprehension is confirmed.
      transition_trigger:
        condition: "comprehension_verified"
        next_event: "E5_EXAMPLE"

    - id: "E5_EXAMPLE"
      name: "Worked Example"
      bloom_level: "apply"
      instructions: |
        Walk through a complete example, showing your reasoning.

        Structure:
        1. Present the problem/scenario
        2. State the approach before solving
        3. Execute step by step, explaining each
        4. Highlight common pitfalls
        5. Summarize the key takeaways

        Make thinking visible: "First I look at... because..."
        Connect back to concepts from E3.
      transition_trigger:
        condition: "student_response_received"
        next_event: "E6_PRACTICE"

    - id: "E6_PRACTICE"
      name: "Guided Practice"
      bloom_level: "apply"
      instructions: |
        Present a similar problem for the student to solve.

        Scaffolding:
        - Start with hints available
        - Let them attempt before correcting
        - Ask guiding questions rather than giving answers

        Feedback:
        - If correct: Confirm and explain WHY it's correct
        - If incorrect: Identify the error type, guide to correction
        - If stuck: Break down into smaller steps

        This is learning, not testing. Encourage attempts.

    - id: "E7_CONNECT"
      name: "Connect and Relate"
      bloom_level: "analyze"
      instructions: |
        Help the student connect this unit to the broader context.

        Connections to make:
        - Previous units in this course
        - Related concepts in other domains
        - Real-world applications
        - Common variations or extensions

        Questions to prompt reflection:
        - "How does this relate to [previous topic]?"
        - "Where might you encounter this in practice?"
        - "What would change if [variation]?"
      transition_trigger:

    - id: "E8_SUMMARIZE"
      name: "Summarize and Conclude"
      bloom_level: "evaluate"
      instructions: |
        Conclude the unit with a clear summary.

        Include:
        - Key concepts covered (bullet points)
        - Main takeaways (2-3 sentences)
        - How this prepares them for the next unit

        Ask the student to self-assess:
        - "On a scale of 1-5, how confident do you feel?"
        - "What aspect would you like to revisit?"

        Offer to clarify anything before moving on.
        Only suggest /next when student is ready.
